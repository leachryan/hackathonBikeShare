currently, an error occurs when the app is used. this is due to bike share hibernating their bikes for the winter.
-a fix: display a message when no data is returned in the JSON string
-this way the app isn't broken on launch

check with https://greatrides.bcycle.com/ periodically for update on bike status

potential features:
-implement google map
-implement wunderground weather status for fargo
